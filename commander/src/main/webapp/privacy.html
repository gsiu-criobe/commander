<h1>TED Commander Privacy Statement</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    Energy, Inc. manufactures and markets electricity monitoring equipment under the brand name “TED – The Energy Detective.”
    The TED-brand of products allow one to view and manage electricity usage in real time within a residence/facility, or from
    remote locations using any mobile device or computer. To provide this ability, we must collect certain information from you.
    Our privacy policy describes how we collect, protect, handle and maintain the information that you provide and that we obtain
    through our cloud-based service, TED Commander.  In this privacy policy, we use the term "System" to refer to the combination
    of TED products and services we provide, including the Services, User Experience, TED Devices and the Energy, Inc. Cloud Server
    ("Cloud Server") that interconnects, via the internet, the User Experience and TED Devices.
</p>
<p>
    We consider your privacy to be very important. In this document, we describe the various kinds of information we collect,
    including your personally identifiable information, and how we treat it below. If you have any questions as to how the
    privacy policy applies to you, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@theenergydetective.com">support@theenergydetective.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By installing and using any portion of the System, you agree to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3>1. Information we collect</h3>
<p>
    We use the term "Information" to refer to any personally identifiable or anonymous information relating to you or your use of any portion of our System. We collect various categories of Information in connection with your use of the System and some of this information may specifically identify you. The following sections describe more specific categories of Information:
</p>

<h4>1.1 Account Information</h4>
<p>Account Information is information about your account, including your Contact Information and Service Information (both defined below) and other account related information that is necessary or useful for us to manage your account, your subscription to optional features or services offered through the Services and privacy preferences.</p>

<p>Account Information does not include any personally identifiable Sensing Information. Account Information may be provided by you or a technology provider, service provider, third party website, merchant involved in the development and/or provision of the functionality of the System, and other third parties with whom we work.</p>

<p>Contact Information means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example: your name, address, telephone number, mobile telephone number, email address, and payment information if applicable.</p>

<p>Service Information means information necessary or useful to us in providing the System to you. Examples of Service Information include your ZIP Code, home system configuration (including appliances you set up to be monitored by the System, schedule, state, mode, rules; utility rates, tariff structure and settings), TED Devices in your home (including types, model numbers and software version numbers). Certain details of the Service Information is collected and transmitted to us whenever a TED Device is connected to the Cloud Server, and by connecting your TED Devices to the Service you are agreeing to have this information transmitted to us. Such information is treated as described below.</p>



<h4>1.2. Sensing Information</h4>
<p>Sensing Information is information captured by TED Devices connected with the System, including the status and diagnostics information from your TED Devices, as well as the information collected by TED Devices, such as power and energy information, and your interaction with TED Devices. We receive this type of information from your TED Devices as they connect with the System.</p>

<h4>1.3. Location Information</h4>
<p>We may collect your exact location or relative location if you choose to enable your TED Devices to send us location information. We do not make Location Information accessible outside your account to anyone you did not explicitly share that information with.  Location Information can be used, for example, to provide weather details pertinent to your location and to the System.</p>

<h4>1.4. System Use Data</h4>
<p>We automatically collect information regarding the actions you take on the System. For example, each time you use the System we automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the System. We use this information to help us understand how people use the System, and to enhance the services we offer.</p>

<h3>2. Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>Like many websites, our website uses "cookies" to recognize you and to help personalize your online experience. We also use cookies to help us understand which parts of the websites are the most popular, where our users are going and how much time they spend at various locations within the websites. The information we collect through cookies is anonymous and we do not access any of your personally identifiable information through the cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. These cookies contain information that can later be read by a web page server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We use cookies to store information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter repeatedly the same information in order to display personalized content on later visits to the Websites.</p>

<p>You have the ability to decline cookies through your web browser. If you choose to decline cookies, however, you may not be able to use the features of the websites that depend on cookies.</p>

<p>The website may contain tiny electronic images known as web beacons. We may use web beacons to assist us in delivering cookies on our Website and to allow us to count users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons in promotional email messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics on the System to collect System Use Data, and to analyze how users use the System. For more information about how to opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.</p>

<h3>3. How We Use Information</h3>
<p>We may use Information to provide and enhance the System, to provide you with customer service and to make a wider range of products and services available to you.</p>

<h4>3.1. Account Information</h4>
<p>We use your personally identifiable Account Information to establish and service your account with us, bill you for optional Services, offer you new services as they become available, assist you in the use of the System (including customer support), communicate with you about the System and offers, and other internal business purposes.  Your Information in aggregate, anonymous form is used to better understand how consumers use our System, which Services they use and who is likely to be interested in receiving certain other services and for other legitimate business purposes.</p>

<h4>3.2. Anonymous Information</h4>
<p>We also anonymize Information by removing your personal Contact Information. Anonymous Information may be associated with or include other Account Information that does not allow us or anyone else to identify you. It allows us to understand usage of the System at a ZIP Code level. Anonymous Information helps us develop reports and analyses about how our customers use our System, Services and TED Devices and for other research such as research regarding behavioral inferences. We may use anonymous Information to troubleshoot technical issues with our System. We may use anonymous Information to compile statistics and reports of usage of the System. To enable technical support, anonymous Information may be identified by a random number that is not stored with your personally identifiable Information. This identifier is capable of linking anonymous information to your personally identifiable information. To further protect your privacy, anonymous Information does not include Contact Information or any other information that would identify any specific individual or household, except as described in the last sentence.</p>

<h4>4.1. Contractors and Third Party Service Providers</h4>
<p>We may use independent contractors to assist with our operations. Such contractors may include programmers, consultants, billing and other agents, auditors, attorneys and accountants, potential purchasers of our business, collection agencies, and third parties who provide services necessary for us to provide the System or conduct business activities in connection with the System. Some of these contractors will have temporary access to our databases of Information. Their access to such information will be limited to specific tasks. We also use third parties to help with certain aspects of our operations, which may require disclosure of your Information to them. For example, we may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or letter) about your account or upcoming features or services, to process and collect payment for your Services via your credit card, to generate demographic profiles based on Information of our customers, and to perform other work as part of or in relation to the System that we may need to outsource. We contractually bind these contractors and third parties to use your Information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform and to use commercially reasonable measures to protect your Information from unauthorized use or disclosure.</p>

<h4>4.2. Service Provider Partners</h4>
<p>If the System is provided through your utility or service provider, we may share Information with your utility or service provider in accordance with your agreement with such utility or service provider.</p>

<h4>4.3. Compliance with the Law: Protection of Our System and Services</h4>
<p>We may disclose Information to governmental agencies, regulators or other third parties if legally required to do so, such as in response to a legal demand issued by a government entity, a subpoena issued in connection with a civil or criminal investigation or litigation or a court order. We may also determine that it is necessary for us to disclose your Account Information and personally identifiable Sensing Information to comply with the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and any other relevant laws, to enforce our applicable Terms of Service, End User License and Service Agreement or any other of our policies, to protect the integrity of our operations and to protect our customers or to prevent a crime.</p>

<h4>4.4. Affiliated Companies</h4>
<p>We may share some or all of your Information with any parent company, subsidiary, joint venture or other company under a common control with us. If this happens, we will require the related company to comply with this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires us, or acquires our assets that comprise or include your Information, we may transfer the Information to that acquiring company, which may put in place its own privacy policy with terms that are different from the terms of this Privacy Policy, but it will provide you with notice of any such changes using the Contact Information that we have for you.</p>

<h3>5. Your Choices Regarding Information</h3>

<h4>5.1. Marketing Information</h4>
<p>After registering a user account in our System, you may receive several automated non-marketing emails to confirm your Account Information and to help you get started.</p>

<h4>5.2. Closing Your Account</h4>
<p>You may terminate your account at any time by unsubscribing or turning off the Service from your computer.</p>

<h3>6. Information from Children</h3>
<p>The System is intended for users who are 18 years old or older. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable Information from children under the age of 18.  If we become aware that we have inadvertently received such Information from a child under the age of 18, we will delete such Information from our records.</p>

<p>If you are a school, district or teacher in the United States and want your students who are under the age of 18 to create accounts with Energy, Inc., you agree that you are responsible for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), and any other applicable laws. This means you must notify those students' parents/guardians of the personally identifiable information Energy, Inc. will collect and obtain parental/guardian consent before your students establish accounts or use the Service. When obtaining such consent, you must provide parents/guardians with a copy of our Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them.</p>

<p>California users under the age of 18 may request the removal of their Content or information publically posted on the System by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:support@theenergydetective.com">support@theenergydetective.com</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that most of the user content that appears on the System is stored and controlled by third party providers; thus, complete and comprehensive removal of the content may not be possible.</p>

<h3>7. Security of Information</h3>

<p>Your privacy is very important to us and we have put in place technical, physical and administrative measures to protect the Information that we collect. No security system is perfect, however, and we cannot guarantee that your Information will not be disclosed to unintended third party recipients. Further, third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access your Information.</p>

<p>When you contact us by email or phone regarding your account, for your security, we may ask you for certain Account Information to verify your identity before accepting requests to make changes to your account. We take these steps to ensure that only you or a household member who knows your Account Information will be able to access or change your Subscriber Information. We use industry-standard security methods, such as encryption, to secure the communication of information throughout the System. In addition, we use industry-standard methods of securing our databases that house Information.</p>

<p>Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we limit access to Information databases to our personnel who have a business need for such access, including servicing your account, informing you of service news and special offers, or aggregating Account Information or anonymous Sensing Information. However, you should know that no company, including our company, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Information.</p>

<p>Private Sensing Information, Service Information, and Contact Information is all encrypted, and in most cases authenticated during transmission.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the best way to protect your security and privacy is to choose a strong password for both your user account and your WiFi network.</p>

<h3>8. Processing in Other Jurisdictions</h3>
<p>Please be aware that your Information and communications may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, or country. If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that we process and store information in the United States. The laws in the United States may not be as protective of your privacy as those in your location. By using the System, you are agreeing to the collection, use, transfer, and disclosure of your Personal Information and communications will be governed by the applicable laws in the United States.</p>

<h3>9. General</h3>

<h4>9.1. Amendments to this Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last modified" date at the top of the privacy statement. We encourage you to review this privacy statement periodically to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the Information we collect. Your continued use of the System constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates. Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the System do not necessarily apply to information you may have provided to us in the context of other of our separately operated products or services.</p>
